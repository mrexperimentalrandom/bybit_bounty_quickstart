# bybit_bounty_quickstart
## lazarus_bounty_lite.sh  Fetches hacker addresses from Bybit Lazarus Bounty API to track the $1.5B Ethereum heist.  ### Usage ./lazarus_bounty_lite.sh [-o &lt;dir>]
## lazarus_random_track.sh Randomly selects 10 addresses and looks for recent transactions. ###Usage ./lazarus_tracker_random.sh 

Rinse and repeat, I figured randomly selecting 10 can save some time and hopefully introduce some luck. There are far too many addresses for one person to go over in a short period of time.
If this helps you, great. I originally planned to keep this to myself. But I would like to help other people participate in the bounty.
